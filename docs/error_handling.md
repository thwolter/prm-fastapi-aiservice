# Error Handling Strategy

This document describes the error handling strategy implemented in the AI Service.

## Overview

The AI Service uses a robust error handling strategy with custom exception classes for different error types. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Consistent error responses**: All errors follow a standard format, making it easier for clients to handle them.
2. **Detailed error information**: Each exception includes specific details about the error, such as error codes and messages.
3. **Proper HTTP status codes**: Each exception maps to an appropriate HTTP status code.
4. **Centralized error handling**: All exceptions inherit from a base class, making it easy to add global error handling logic.

## Exception Hierarchy

The exception hierarchy is as follows:

- `BaseServiceException`: The base class for all service exceptions.
  - `ValidationException`: Raised when data validation fails.
  - `RequestException`: Raised when there's an issue with the request structure.
  - `AuthenticationException`: Raised when authentication fails.
  - `AuthorizationException`: Raised when authorization fails.
  - `ResourceNotFoundException`: Raised when a requested resource is not found.
  - `ExternalServiceException`: Raised when an external service call fails.
  - `RateLimitException`: Raised when rate limits are exceeded.
  - `QuotaExceededException`: Raised when a user's quota is exceeded.
  - `InternalServerException`: Raised for unexpected internal server errors.

## Usage

To use these exceptions in your code, import them from `src.utils.exceptions` and raise them when appropriate:

```python
from src.utils.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundException

def get_user(user_id):
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise ResourceNotFoundException(detail=f"User {user_id} not found")
    return user
```

## Error Response Format

When an exception is raised, it will be caught by FastAPI and converted to an HTTP response with the appropriate status code and a JSON body containing the error details:

```json
{
  "detail": "User 123 not found"
}
```

Some exceptions include additional information, such as validation errors or retry-after headers.

## Testing

The exception classes are thoroughly tested in `tests/test_exceptions.py`. The tests verify that:

1. Each exception has the correct properties (status code, detail, headers, error code).
2. The exceptions are handled correctly by FastAPI.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the error handling strategy include:

1. Adding a middleware to catch and log all exceptions.
2. Implementing a more detailed error response format with additional fields.
3. Adding support for internationalization of error messages.
